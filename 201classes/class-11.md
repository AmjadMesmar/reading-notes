## Article Summary: Video and Audio APIs

- The <***video***> and <***audio***> elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. As we showed in Video and audio content, a typical implementation looks like this:

      <video controls>
      <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
      </video>

## The HTMLMediaElement API

- Part of the HTML5 spec, the ***HTMLMediaElement*** API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically â€” for example ***HTMLMediaElementplay()***., ***HTMLMediaElement.pause()***., etc This interface is available to both <***audio***> and <***video***> elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical.

- The ***HTMLMediaElement*** API makes a wealth of functionality available for creating simple video and audio players, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. See the "See also" section below for links to more complex and interesting functionality.
