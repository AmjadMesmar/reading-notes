# Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Advantages to Test Driven Development:

1. Better program design and higher code quality.

2. Detailed project documentation.

3. TDD reduces the time required for project development.

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- When using logging middleware.

### Some downsides of Test Driven Development

1. No silver bullet –
Tests help to seek out bugs, but they can not find bugs that you simply introduce within the test code and in implementation code. If you haven’t understood the matter you would like to unravel, writing tests most likely doesn’t help.

2. slow process –
If you begin TDD, you’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of your time for straightforward implementations. you would like to believe the interfaces, write the test code, and run the tests before you’ll finally start writing the code.

3. All the members of a team got to do it –
As TDD influences the planning of code, it’s recommended that either all the members of a team use TDD or nobody in the least. additionally, to the present, it’s sometimes difficult to justify TDD to the management because they often have the sensation that the implementation of latest features takes longer if developers write code that will not find themselves within the product half the time. It helps if the entire team agrees on the importance of unit tests.

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

 The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. ... A constructor in JavaScript is just a plain old function that returns an object.

### Why REST?

- REST aims to make caching easier. Since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually, GET requests should usually return the same response regardless of previous ones and the session. This makes the GET requests easily cacheable and browsers usually treat them as such.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. Functional programmin: Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

2. object-oriented programming (OOP): Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

3. Class: In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). ... In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a metaclass.

4. super: super is a keyword. It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class. Private methods of the super-class cannot be called. Only public and protected methods can be called by the super keyword. It is also used by class constructors to invoke constructors of its parent class.

5. this: In many object-oriented programming languages, this (also called self or Me ) is a variable that is used in instance methods to refer to the object on which they are working. The first OO language, SIMULA 67, used this to explicitly reference the local object.

6. Test Driven Development (TDD): Test-driven development is a process of modifying the code in order to pass a test designed previously. In Software Engineering, It is sometimes known as "Test First Development." TDD includes refactoring a code i.e. changing/adding some amount of code to the existing code without affecting the behavior of the code.

7. jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte. Jest does not require a lot of configuration for first time users of a testing framework.

8. Continuous Integration (CI): Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.

9. REST: Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful.

10. Data Model: A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. ... So the "data model" of a banking application may be defined using the entity-relationship "data model".
