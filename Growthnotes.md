**Growth Mindset** means that the person's ability can be developed with effort and facing challenges, and that talent and intellegence are just a good starting point only, It's the contrary of a **Fixed Mindset** which believes that only talent and intellegence what makes a person successful and if you didn't inhert these traits you wont develope your skills and succeed. 

- ***Challenges:***
 
 People with a **Fixed Mindset** will try to solve the problem from only one perspective and then surrender with the belief that it's impossible for them to solve it.

To have a **Growth Mindset**, you will have to take a step back, rethink your strategy and find new ways and methods to solve the issue and find a solution, meaning you have to embrace the challenge not avoiding it!

- ***Obstacles:***

To have a **Growth Mindset**, you have to avoid diverting your attention to other things other than the problem which may lead you to lose focus; Sometimes you only have to step back,take a breath and come back to the issue later when you are inspired and more focused.

-***Effort:***

To have a **Growth Mindset**, you have to put effort of you are doing, nothing will change and you wont learn a thing without doing an actual effort, no pain,no gain!

-***Criticism:***

At the end of your day always ask yourself:

1.What was the best part of the day?

2.What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?

Answering these questions will help you to put better strategies to have better days in the future,also doing this will help you process your coworkers' criticisim.

-***Success of others:***

Part of having a **Growth Mindset** is being happy for others' success and make them your source of inspiration, being jealous and hating their success will only damage you and your peers.
